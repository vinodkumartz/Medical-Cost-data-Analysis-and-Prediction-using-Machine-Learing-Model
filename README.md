# Medical Cost Data Analysis and Prediction üè•üìà

This project focuses on analyzing medical cost data and predicting future medical expenses using machine learning models. By exploring patient demographic and health-related features, the objective is to uncover patterns and build models that can aid healthcare providers, insurance companies, and policymakers in making informed, data-driven decisions.

## Overview
This project analyzes and predicts future medical expenses based on a dataset containing information about patient demographics, health attributes, and charges. The goal is to understand the factors influencing medical costs and build predictive models that estimate future expenses accurately. The insights gained can help in planning healthcare policies and managing medical insurance pricing strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of various features that typically influence medical expenses, such as:
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **BMI (Body Mass Index)**
- **Smoking status**
- **Number of children**
- **Region**
- **Medical charges (target variable)**

## Project Pipeline
1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values.
   - Encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, region).
   - Normalizing or scaling numerical features like BMI and age for better model performance.
   - Understanding feature distributions and their correlation with the target variable (medical charges).

2. **Feature Engineering**
   - Analyzing the correlation between features to identify the most influential factors.
   - Creating new derived features or transforming existing ones to improve predictive power.

3. **Model Selection and Training**
   - Training machine learning models, including:
     - **Linear Regression**
     - **RandomForest Regression**
     - **Gradient Boosting**
     - **Support Vector Regression**
   - Tuning hyperparameters for each model to achieve optimal performance.

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluating the models using metrics such as:
     - **R2-Score**
     - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - Comparing model performances to select the best one.

## Models Used
- **Linear Regression**: A simple regression model that estimates the relationship between the dependent variable (medical charges) and independent variables (features like age, BMI, etc.).
- **RandomForest Regression**: An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions for better accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: A boosting algorithm that builds models sequentially, with each new model correcting the errors of the previous ones.
- **Support Vector Regression**: A regression model that attempts to fit the best possible hyperplane between data points to predict continuous values.

## Results
The model performance was evaluated using several error metrics, and the best-performing model was chosen based on:
- **R2-Score**: [85.25%]
- **MAE**: [2776.8]

The most influential factors impacting medical costs were:
- [Charges]
- [Age]
- [BMI]

## Dependencies
- Python (version 3.x)
- Libraries:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualizations)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the analysis and train the models.

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project demonstrated the potential of machine learning to predict medical expenses based on patient attributes. Future work can focus on:
- Collecting more granular data (e.g., medical history, treatment types) to enhance prediction accuracy.
- Exploring deep learning models for more complex relationships between features.
